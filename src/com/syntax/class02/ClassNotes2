Selenium Class02

What is WebElement?
   anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement.
   etc. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, title, link

HTML ?
 HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM ?
  DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
  internal view of the webpage
  Alse called as Developer's tools or Dev tools

Document --> can be stored any document such as pdf, excel...
Object   --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
Model    --> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
is an address or a position of an webelement on the web page
is used to locate or identify webelements on the web page

8 Locators:
- ID
- Name
- TagName
- Xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinkText
- Css Selector
- ClassName

HTML Scripting Meaning:
purple --> tags -> button , input, div
brown  --> attributes -> name, class, id
blue   --> attribute value

Why do we need many locators?
-- developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-- some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
-- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
e.g. linkText and partialLinkText are only used for links

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag <a>

if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values,
selenium will only interact with the first element it locates
