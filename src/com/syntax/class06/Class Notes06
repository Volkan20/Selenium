Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on
We cannot proceed until it is handled

we have 3 Types of Alerts:
1) Web based alerts     / html alerts    - we can simply inspect and perform need actions
2) Javascript alerts(JS)/ browser alerts - we can handle these alerts bt using switchTo method
                                          we cannot inspect
3) Windows based alerts /    - we cannot handle with Selenium

Types of JS alerts:
1. Simple alert       - click ok
2. Confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. prompt alert       - enter text and then click ok or cancel


To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept()  - click ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()

To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the URL
"https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
         //username:password@ <--how we write the info in pop up

Frames:
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with Frames:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by WebElement

in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page

Interview Question:
How do you handle Alerts in selenium ?
We handle Alerts by using Alert interface
